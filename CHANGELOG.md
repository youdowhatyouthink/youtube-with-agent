# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v3.0.0 — 2026-09-01

Rebranded to YouTube With Automatic (agent identity: Automic), with the underlying pipeline, agents, and dashboard unchanged. Full security and Windows-readiness pass:

- Rebranded the project, dashboard, console output, and generic agent identity throughout; replaced all original-project author/credit references and squashed git history to a single initial commit
- Split the original project's MIT notice into THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md, preserved verbatim, as required by its license
- Patched 27 of 29 known dependency vulnerabilities (1 critical, 18 high, 8 moderate, 2 low), including major-version updates to sqlite3, node-cron, and sharp; the 2 remaining moderate advisories have no upstream fix available yet
- Added a startup capability check for Chromium (the local slideshow video path's dependency), with a clear install hint instead of a silent fallback to simulated, unpublishable output
- Added a Windows quick start to the README
- Added windows-latest to CI alongside ubuntu-latest, which caught and led to fixes for two Windows-only bugs: a temp-directory cleanup race and a leaked file handle from an unconsumed upload stream in a test
- Removed superseded internal planning documents for an already-shipped feature

## v2.10.0 — 2026-08-24

- Added a versioned DarkzSEO discoverability preflight over a shell-free Python stdin/stdout adapter, with explicit unavailable and schema-mismatch states
- Added durable discoverability audits and findings, reviewer keep/dismiss decisions with required false-positive reasons, and review evidence carry-forward across matching audits
- Added an advisory Review Studio panel and API controls; discoverability findings never rewrite content or block publication in this release
- Added a Controlled Growth Experiments Studio that turns approved-learning title and thumbnail variants into durable post-publication test plans
- Added separate plan approval, live-start confirmation, bounded arm rotation, control restoration, and winner-adoption gates; no experiment can silently adopt a live change
- Added real YouTube evidence samples for each arm using interval deltas for impressions, estimated clicks, CTR, views, watch time, retention, engagement, subscribers, and revenue
- Added minimum-exposure, 95% evidence, retention-regression, and traffic-mix guardrails with an explicit inconclusive result when the evidence is weak or confounded
- Added four-hour experiment refresh scheduling, restart-safe SQLite state, dashboard controls, read/mutation APIs, and approved-winner handoff into future channel planning
- Added a structured channel-outcome contract with primary KPI, numeric target, measurement window, monthly production budget, and currency while retaining free-text outcome context
- Added independent YouTube subscriber and monetization collection so unavailable revenue never converts otherwise-real analytics into simulated data or false zeroes
- Extended real performance snapshots with net subscribers, watch hours, subscriber and revenue efficiency, known production cost, net revenue, and ROI evidence
- Added an Outcome & ROI Studio dashboard with target progress, evidence coverage, channel economics, and pillar, format, and provider comparisons
- Added approval-gated outcome-allocation recommendations; pending or rejected recommendations cannot change autonomous planning
- Added `GET /api/outcomes`, structured strategy validation, content-pillar propagation, database migrations, and regression coverage for goal alignment and non-monetized channels
- Established a platform-targeted audit contract for future TikTok and Instagram/Reels publishing and analytics adapters; those adapters are not included in v2.10.0

## v2.9.0 — 2026-08-23

- Added a persistent Audience Engagement Studio: tapered read-only comment sync for recent videos with a strict no-simulated-comments policy
- Added AI comment classification into themes, sentiment, and flags, with spam/scam/toxic quarantine (flag-only; no moderation actions) and a weak non-AI fallback that never invents insights
- Added approval-only reply drafting and posting with an explicit confirmation, a youtube.force-ssl re-consent gate, posting evidence, and a daily reply cap
- Added audience-demand idea mining (3+ repeated asks) into the existing approval-gated recommendations pipeline, feeding approved requests into autonomous planning
- Added an Engagement dashboard view, five /api/engagement endpoints, and a four-hour engagement sync automation slot
- Added persistent scene-aware audience-retention snapshots using YouTube's granular elapsed-time curve, with separate long-form and Shorts evidence
- Mapped retention points onto durable production scenes and classified scene-level drop-off, rewatch, strong-hold, and steady signals
- Added an accessible dashboard retention curve, scene evidence cards, manual read-only refresh, and stored-evidence API
- Added approval-gated scene-retention recommendations; missing, sparse, and simulated curves remain excluded and published videos are never edited automatically
- Added a persistent Shorts Repurposing Studio that proposes source-scene-backed vertical excerpts from an existing production without new provider calls
- Added local 9:16 FFmpeg rendering with blurred-canvas, center-crop, and stacked-focus layouts plus mobile-safe burned captions and SRT output
- Added independent Short review, evidence inheritance, scheduling, publishing-state reconciliation, and Shorts-specific analytics context
- Made narration fail-closed across production assembly, quality review, scheduling, and publishing; missing TTS can no longer silently become an approvable video
- Added narration-only scene recovery with persistent provider, model, task, generation-time, cost, and failure evidence
- Added a reasoned, reversible intentional-silence override and scene-aware silent-segment mixing for explicitly silent productions
- Added a persistent Scene Repair Studio with scene-level narration, prompts, timing, provider/task evidence, asset origin, rights state, source links, locks, and revision history
- Added selective scene editing, reordering, paid regeneration confirmation, licensed image/video replacement, narration invalidation, and scene-aware caption rebuilding
- Final scene rebuilds now create a new MP4 while preserving the previous artifact; incomplete, stale, unlicensed, or unrepaired scenes block approval
- Added a durable video-provider layer for Seedance 2.5, MiniMax H3, Gemini Omni Flash, Kling 3.0 Omni, and Wan 2.7
- Added capability-aware automatic routing with local slideshow as the no-cost default and final fallback
- Added persistent external media task IDs, provider/model evidence, cancellation handoff where supported, and restart-safe reuse of known provider tasks
- Added hybrid long-form assembly, per-production paid-seconds caps, truthful fallback metadata, and automatic synthetic-media review handoff
- Added dashboard provider controls and a separately opted-in paid AI-video readiness probe

## v2.8.0 — 2026-08-21

- Added a persistent Research & Provenance Desk with source metadata, claim-to-source links, reviewer status, notes, and evidence summaries
- Preserved exact YouTube trend and competitor source URLs through autonomous planning and into script generation
- Added AI-declared factual claims that may reference only sources supplied by the research stage
- Made unresolved claims blocking; supported claims require verified evidence and claim waivers require reviewer notes
- Added Review Studio controls for adding and reviewing sources and claims, including official, article, video, dataset, asset-license, and other evidence types
- Added realistic altered or synthetic media disclosure and passed the reviewed value into YouTube upload metadata

## v2.7.0 — 2026-08-21

- Added persistent per-stage generation checkpoints with artifact validation, bounded retry-safe backoff, and resume-from-first-incomplete behavior
- Added dashboard controls to resume failed or interrupted jobs from a selected stage while showing saved and reused stages
- Added Autonomous Channel Operator recovery from stored research, editorial plans, ideas, and interrupted generation jobs
- Preserved the actual generation stage across application restarts instead of replacing it with a generic interrupted stage
- Made scheduling idempotent per production and added YouTube upload reconciliation so recorded or uncertain uploads cannot be duplicated automatically
- Added API endpoints for individual-job and operator-run recovery plus regression coverage for restart, reuse, transient retry, and duplicate-upload safety

## v2.6.0 — 2026-08-20

- Added a user-triggered Production Readiness Gate with live text, narration, YouTube-access, local audio/video MP4, and queued-metadata probes; paid image verification is explicit opt-in
- Added persistent readiness evidence and a dashboard remediation panel; recorded blocking failures now stop autonomous runs and publishing until a later check clears them
- Added YouTube metadata normalization and fail-fast upload validation to prevent malformed AI-generated tags from reaching the upload API
- Added an approval-gated Channel Learning Engine that captures real 24-hour and 7-day performance snapshots, derives channel-relative baselines, and feeds only approved recommendations into future autonomous plans
- Added a dashboard learning review with evidence, confidence, approve/reject controls, and operator-selected title/thumbnail variants for approved packaging experiments; simulated analytics are explicitly excluded from learning
- Added a persistent Autonomous Channel Operator that turns a channel objective, audience, pillars, cadence, and guardrails into researched editorial plans and sequential end-to-end production runs
- Added dashboard strategy controls, operator-run progress and cancellation, scheduled strategy execution, and approval-gated publishing handoff
- Added local-only activation milestones for setup, first real MP4, approval, publication, and repeat generation
- Added an explicit opt-in anonymous milestone reporter with no default endpoint
- Added reproducible GitHub growth baselines and public fork census reports
- Reworked the README around product outcomes and moved release history here
- Refreshed active provider defaults and selectors for Gemini 3.7 Flash, Claude Fable 5, and the current OpenRouter catalog

## v2.5

- **Operator-first dashboard** — live jobs, content pipeline, review queue, calendar, idea backlog, analytics, and channel setup in one responsive console
- **Asynchronous generation** — generation returns immediately with a persistent job ID; progress, errors, cancellation, and restart interruptions are visible
- **Approval-first publishing** — generated content must pass quality checks, factual review, media-rights confirmation, and human approval before it can be scheduled by default
- **Review studio** — preview real video and thumbnail assets, edit title/description/tags/privacy/schedule, reject, retry, or approve
- **Brand guardrails** — channel goal, audience, voice, CTA, visual direction, timezone, and blocked-topic policy guide generation and quality review
- **Actionable operations** — pause/resume automation, webhook-ready notifications, real activity history, and warning-free linting

## v2.4

- **Guided walkthrough for first-time setup** — `npm run walkthrough` explains each choice, opens provider pages, tests keys, guides Google Cloud setup, and saves progress
- **`.env` loading fixed** — runtime and setup tools now load local environment settings
- **Safer example environment** — placeholder credentials are commented out
- **Browser OAuth opens automatically** — YouTube authorization opens in the default browser

## v2.3

- **Gemini media pipeline** — Gemini image generation (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`) and narration (`gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`) are supported. Text and TTS currently have free tiers; AI image generation requires Gemini paid-tier access. Gradient visuals remain the no-image-provider fallback.
- **Faster slideshow rendering** — the renderer captures one still per slide and uses FFmpeg for video and crossfades
- **Better template topics** — template mode uses curated evergreen topics and rejects malformed trend fragments
- **Model catalog correction** — removed the nonexistent `gemini-3.5-pro` entry in favor of supported Gemini models

## v2.2

- Any configured AI text provider can satisfy startup credential validation
- FFmpeg is bundled through `ffmpeg-static`
- Successful production reaches the publish queue
- Silent real MP4 output is supported when TTS is not configured
- Startup reports real versus simulated capabilities
- Missing credentials and FFmpeg produce actionable warnings
- Publish-queue logging reports queue state and timing

## v2.1

- Real AI generation for strategy, scripts, and SEO
- Optional API-key protection for mutating routes
- Private-by-default publishing and placeholder upload protection
- Scheduler, dependency, database, and publish-queue fixes
- Template scripts no longer fabricate statistics
- ESLint and GitHub Actions CI

## v2.0

- Provider and media model refresh
- OpenAI SDK v6, `@google/genai` v2.9, `replicate` v1.4, and `googleapis` v173
- Revamped setup wizard and TTS selection
- Deprecated OpenAI SDK call patterns removed
- Dynamic year handling in content strategy
- Developer-focused README and Mermaid architecture diagrams
